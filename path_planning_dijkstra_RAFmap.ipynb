    "# Dijkstra's Algorithm for Robotic Path Planning\n",
    "\n",
    "Dijkstra's Algorithm is a graph-based pathfinding algorithm that **guarantees** the \"shortest\" path in a weighted graph. In the context of robotics, it is particularly useful for path planning in known environments. Possible applications are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Warehouse navigation: Robots use grid-based pathfinding to navigate around shelves.\n",
    "2. Obstacle avoidance: Works well in structured environments with known obstacles.\n",
    "3. Autonomous vehicles: Grid-based path planning can be used for local navigation.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook explains Dijkstra's Algorithm in the context of robotic path planning. We'll visualize how the algorithm works and provide a Python implementation for an example grid-based graph."

    "The following concepts are important for the understanding the explanation that follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Graph Representation**: The environment is represented as a graph where each node corresponds to a position (or grid cell), and edges represent possible movements.\n",
    "2. **Weighted Edges**: The weights represent the cost of moving from one node to another, such as distance, difficulty or energy required.\n",
    "3. **Optimal Path**: The algorithm finds the least-cost path from a start node to a goal node. Such a path is the shortest if the distances between nodes represent the cost for moving between them. However, if the costs include other aspects (like required energy, risk of collision etc.), the optimal path will not necessarily be the shortest one."
