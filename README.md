# Jupyter Notebooks for learning Mobile Robot Control

These Jupyter Notebooks are intended to support the learning of basic concepts of mobile robot control via Python coding. They focus on the differential-drive mobile robot. They can be used independently or as support material for the [Robotics Simulation Labs](https://felipenmartins.github.io/Robotics-Simulation-Labs/).

### Content
- [Odometry-based Localization](https://github.com/felipenmartins/jupyter-notebooks/blob/main/odometry-based_localization.ipynb) for the differential-drive robot
- [Implementation of simple robot behaviors](https://github.com/felipenmartins/jupyter-notebooks/blob/main/robot_behaviors.ipynb) for mobile robot control
- [Mobile Robot Control with PID](https://github.com/felipenmartins/jupyter-notebooks/blob/main/robot_control_with_PID.ipynb) to implement position control

### Requirements
- Jupyter Notebook
- Python 3.10 or higher
- NumPy
