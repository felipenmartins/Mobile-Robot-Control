# Jupyter Notebooks for learning Mobile Robot Control

These Jupyter Notebooks are intended to support the learning of basic concepts of mobile robot control via Python coding. They focus on the differential-drive mobile robot. 

The notebooks can be used as support material for the [Robotics Simulation Labs](https://felipenmartins.github.io/Robotics-Simulation-Labs/) without the need of installing Webots. They can be useful to understand the fundamentals of the corresponding topic, especially because they allow step-by-step execution and experimentation of the implemented functions.
